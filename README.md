# Graduation-Project
Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments Binary Segmentation (2023 fall - 2024 spring)

• Designed a novel deep learning network based on U-Net architecture with Transformer, and tested on the Endovis2017 dataset for surgical instruments binary segmentation

• Implemented ablation experiments to verify the efficiency of each part of the network including attention mechanism and residual blocks

• Segmented the sequenced images extracted from the video, approximately achieved the surgical instrument tracking and performed faster compared to others
